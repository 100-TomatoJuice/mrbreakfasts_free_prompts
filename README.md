Inspired by the look and freedom of [Kenney](https://kenney.nl/assets/input-prompts-pixel-16) and the freedom of [Xelu's](https://thoseawesomeguys.com/prompts/) free prompts.

Remix the source here, or download and support the pack on [Itch.io](https://mrbreakfastsdelight.itch.io/mr-breakfasts-free-prompts)

### 🛋️ Supports:
- Nintendo Switch
- Xbox Series
- PlayStation™ 5
- Steam Deck
- Generic game pad
- Keyboard and mouse

### 🪛 How is the Source made?
The source was designed in [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/). The assets are created with fill gradients, strokes, and the Poppins font. The gradients are locked and shared between the assets, allowing for easy edits of the dark and light color schemes.

Here's an example of a generic light button:

And the gradients included so far:

Many of the triggers/bumpers were created using Inkscape's Corner live path effect. The keyboard keys have a separate gradient from the buttons for their light and dark schemes.
